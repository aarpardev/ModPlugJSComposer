# OpenMPT JS Tracker Music Maker

This is a quick fun little Javascript app that can composes random music for OpenMPT Tracker. Simply enter some notes, select a preset with a combination of rows for an epic random composition! After the composition is generated, scroll down, copy the resulting text starting from ModPlug Tracker XM, and paste it into a tracker channel in your OpenMPT project. (Note: currently works for .xm projects at this point). The rows do not apply with the EDM and Breakbeat presets. 

- Source code can be run by opening index.html in your favourite browser (no python or VSCode live server required)
- May add more presets in the future 
- It's highly recommended to have one sample/tracker instrument loaded before using this tool.
