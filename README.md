# OpenMPT JS Tracker Music Maker

This is a quick fun little Javascript app that can composes random music for OpenMPT Tracker. This project was created for the purpose of learning ES6. Simply enter some notes, select "Compose" or "Eights" for a random composition, scroll down, copy the resulting text starting from ModPlug Tracker XM, and paste it into a tracker channel in your OpenMPT project. (Note: currently works for .xm projects at this point). The rows do not apply with the EDM and Breakbeat presets.
