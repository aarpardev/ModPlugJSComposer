# OpenMPT JS Tracker Music Maker

This is a quick fun little Javascript app that composes random music for OpenMPT Tracker created for the purpose of learning ES6. Simply enter some notes, select "Compose" or "Eights" for a random composition, scroll down, copy the resulting text starting from ModPlug Tracker XM, and paste it into a tracker channel in your project. (Note: currently works for .xm projects at this point).
