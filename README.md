# OpenMPT JS Tracker Music Maker

This is a quick fun little Javascript app that can composes random music for OpenMPT Tracker. Simply enter some notes, select a preset with a combination of rows for an epic random composition! After the composition is generated, scroll down, copy the resulting text starting from ModPlug Tracker XM, and paste it into a tracker channel in your OpenMPT project. (Note: currently works for .xm projects at this point).

- Source code can be run by opening index.html in your favourite browser (no python or VSCode live server required)
- It's highly recommended to have one sample/tracker instrument loaded before using this tool.
- As of June 2023, the code is being worked on to be OOP optimized along with features currently being planned that give the user more control over results.
